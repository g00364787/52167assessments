The  ord()  function  returns a number which is the equivalent of the input character given to it. 
It is the equivalent to the BASIC function ASC(x) where the the returned number is the ASCII equivalent of the input character 'x' .
e.g  ord(x) where x is the character 'A' will return 65  or where x is the character 'Z' will return the number 90.
